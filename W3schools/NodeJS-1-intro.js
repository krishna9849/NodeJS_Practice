Why Node.js ?

 It is a server side  javascript env , open source , asynchronous programming , non blocking i/o 

Why Nodejs is async ?

Requirement : a user req a file read content

NodeJS will do : 
1. send a task to computer file system
2. ready to handle next req 
3. process the step 1 req that means when file system open as per requirement it reads data and send response

where as php/ ASP :
send a task
wait for task to complete
ready to handle new task
